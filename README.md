# Pasar Malam Kebaya
By Raihanah Nabilah Fatinah

## Background

This is a clothing e-commerce, inspired by my own thrifting shop, @pasarmalamkebaya on Instagram. I built this as a way for me to learn various parts of Full-Stack Development that I am still not familiar with (i.e. login authentication and authorization, payment gateway, etc).

## Set up


## Technical Description

## Plan
I will try to finish the backend first, then I will continue with the frontend part. 

## Acknowledgement

I was able to build this project because of the Go Bootcamp that I participated in June 2023 under the instruction of Mas Faerul Salamun and Mas Hidayat Abisena. The majority of the development here was inspired from my learning experience in the bootcamp.
